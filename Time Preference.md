# Time Preference

The concept of time preference is central to economic analysis and is closely related to the nature of human action. In the face of uncertainty, all individuals must make choices about how to allocate their scarce resources over time to achieve their desired ends. The degree to which individuals prefer present satisfaction over future satisfaction is described as their time preference.

The extent of time preference varies across individuals and is influenced by a variety of factors, including personal preferences, expectations about future events, and the availability of credit. Some individuals may have a high time preference, meaning that they prefer immediate gratification and are less willing to delay consumption. In contrast, others may have a low time preference, meaning that they are willing to delay consumption in favor of greater future returns.

It is important to note that time preference is a subjective concept, and there is no objective measure of what constitutes a "good" or "bad" time preference. Rather, time preference is a personal preference that varies across individuals, and it is up to each individual to decide how to allocate their resources over time.

One important implication of the concept of time preference is that all actors display at least a positive time preference. This means that every act leads to a realized satisfaction of ends, rather than being deferred to the future. Only non-actors, such as rocks or inanimate objects, can be considered to have zero time preference.

In conclusion, time preference is a central concept in economic analysis that helps to explain why individuals choose to allocate their resources over time in the way that they do. It is a subjective preference that varies across individuals, and it is not objectively better or worse to have a higher or lower time preference. By understanding the nature of time preference, economists and individuals alike can better understand the nature of human action and the choices that individuals make when faced with uncertainty.

The interest rate serves as a market signal that helps coordinate these decisions by providing a price for the use of capital. High interest rates encourage individuals to save and invest resources for future consumption, while low interest rates encourage consumption in the present. The market-based nature of interest rates also ensures that they are flexible and responsive to changes in time preference, supply and demand, and other market factors.
