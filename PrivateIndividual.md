# The Theory of the Private Individual

## The Human Axioms

There are two intertwined axioms at the very heart of our problem: humans act and humans argue.

The action axiom states that men allocate means in order to satisfy ends. Men are in a current state of uneasiness, with the creative imagination of numerous future scenarios, capable of making a value judgement and rank ordering these scenarios, and being able to reason about the costs of achieving them. In hindsight, humans judge weather or not the goal has been achieved and the situation improved.

Any attempt to refute the action axiom would in it self be an action, a behavior targeted at a goal, requiring resources, considering the opportunity cost of alternatives, and ultimately subject to a judgment of success or failure. The action axiom is self-evident for actors, and non-actors are not capable of reaching participatory understanding of it.

The argumentation axiom is that humans are capable of reasoning and discerning truth from falsehood. Lower forms of communication include sounds of expression like cries of pain, and warnings or signals of danger. Whereas higher communication entails descriptive language, which can be either true or false, and ultimately argumentation, which entails provable logic and explicit inferences. 

Similarly to the action axiom, a claim that one cannot argue would in it of itself be an argument, proclaiming a certain fact to be true, while others are false. Notice that this conundrum is also present for the isolated individual, as alone the thought of "I cannot argue" is an internal argument as well. Furthermore, verbal behavior can only be understood and categorized as argumentation, if the observer has prior reflective cognition. In other words, an argument can only be observed by someone who knows how to argue.

## Uneasiness

Humans are in a constant state of uneasiness. Or in other words, humans always have problems. Just one example is the physical requirement to supply the body with food and energy to continue to function. But regardless of how many problems have already been solved, there are always more things that can be improved, there is always more potential. There is the universal tendency towards entropy and decay.

## Ends

The general goal of humans is to alleviate uneasiness, to apply the solutions to the problems. This requires the creative spark to imagining a future where the problem is in fact solved.

## Means

Actors utilize means to achieve their ends. Means are the resources required in order to remove uneasiness. Without utilization of the means, the problem cannot be solved.

### Scarcity

Scarce means can only be utilized for one task at any given time. If there are multiple different tasks that all require the same mean, then the actor cannot satisfy all goals at the same time, he must choose one goal, and thus sacrifice the achievement of all other possible goals. Out of scarcity emerges a potential conflict of how to allocate the scarce resources available. 

Physical resources are scarce, as they can only be in one place at any given time.

If there are not enough scarce goods available to satisfy all the ends, then these goods must be economized. They must be allocated carefully, because if the good is applied to a less important problem, then it will not be available for solving the more important one. 

On the other hand, if the scarce good is abundant, then it is not subject to economization and can be considered a non-restraint for action. For example, air is generally abundant on earth's atmosphere, thus there is no need to economize how much air to breath in. However, once underwater and with only a small bottle of pressurized air, the actually scarce resource will be consumed quickly, and thus the actor has to economize how to use the resource.

### Non-Scarcity

There are however, non-scarce means that can be utilized for as many tasks as desired, simultaneously and at infinite scale. Thus there is no question of for which task to apply the good, the good is available for any possible task. No opportunity cost, and no sacrifice.

Information, patterns and ideas are non-scarce, they can be copied ad infinitum without taking away the use from anyone. The individual can continuously use the same strategy and information across solving different problems. He does not "forget" a piece of information after using it.

## Subjective marginal preference

Each individual can, subjectively, rank order all his current points of uneasiness, by taking two problems, and asking which of them is worse. When doing this with all current problems, we end up with a ordered list of the most serious problem on the top, and each following being less important.

Likewise, individuals can rank order their subjective value for any mean, based on which better removes the uneasiness. This judgement is possible for goods in the same solution category, like a hungry man preferring steak over bananas. But this also works across categories, a man who is both hungry and thirsty will still prefer one over the other,  water or steak. 

These are ordinal value scales, it is an absolute rank ordering. We cannot say by how much "units" one problem is worse, but only that one is generally worse than the other. This ordering of problems and means into a hierarchy is helpful in finding out what the most pressing problem is, the one that if alleviated, the uneasiness would reduce the most.

## Choice

Choice, then, is at the core of what it means to be human. With numerous problems, but limited scarce resources, humans must inevitably make a value judgement and choose one out of many. Every single action, is the proof of that choice, and it implies the infinite number of alternatives that have been sacrificed.

## Judgement

Judgement is the other side of choice. After the act, individuals can judge themselves regarding weather or not their allocation of means has lead to their ends being achieved.

## Time

Time then, at least perceived by the individual, is experienced within every action. There is a clear differentiation in the timeline of "before" and "after" the act. 

Memory of past actions and their results guide current moment decision making. Previous successful application of means to achieve ends are positively remembered and attempted again. Whereas those means that lead to a failure are noted for their disutility.

Yet every act presupposes the imagination of future scenarios, with consideration of how the individual actor can causally influence these. Precisely because of this plentiful human imagination, the future becomes uncertain. Out of all the possible dreams, which single one will manifest as actuality?

Once the act is done, there is no turning it back, time has passed irreversibly. Time travel is not possible, neither going back in time and choosing a different action, nor going forward in time to see the actual result of potential actions.

## Time Preference

The total time of individual human existence is limited, and the future is uncertain. It is very well possible to die in the very next instance, and the chances of death increase the longer we predict in the future.

Therefor it is reasonable to assume, that all things equal, individuals prefer satisfaction of their ends sooner, rather than later. The extend of how far gratification can be delayed is described as time preference. The longer an individual can delay satisfaction, the lower his time preference.

The extend of time preference varies across individual, and there it is not objectively better or worse to have a higher or lower time preference. This is a human preference, which is subjective to every actor, and thus no qualitative judgement can be made.

However, any actor displays at least a positive time preference. Every act leads to a realized satisfaction of ends, not deferred to the future. Thus only a non-actor can be considered to have a zero time preference.
