# The Theory of the Private Individual

## The Human Axioms

There are two intertwined axioms at the very heart of our problem: humans act and humans argue.

The action axiom states that men allocate means in order to satisfy ends. Men are in a current state of uneasiness, with the creative imagination of numerous future scenarios, capable of making a value judgement and rank ordering these scenarios, and being able to reason about the costs of achieving them. In hindsight, humans judge weather or not the goal has been achieved and the situation improved.

Any attempt to refute the action axiom would in it self be an action, a behavior targeted at a goal, requiring resources, considering the opportunity cost of alternatives, and ultimately subject to a judgment of success or failure. The action axiom is self-evident for actors, and non-actors are not capable of reaching participatory understanding of it.

The argumentation axiom is that humans are capable of reasoning and discerning truth from falsehood. Lower forms of communication include sounds of expression like cries of pain, and warnings or signals of danger. Whereas higher communication entails descriptive language, which can be either true or false, and ultimately argumentation, which entails provable logic and explicit inferences. 

Similarly to the action axiom, a claim that one cannot argue would in it of itself be an argument, proclaiming a certain fact to be true, while others are false. Notice that this conundrum is also present for the isolated individual, as alone the thought of "I cannot argue" is an internal argument as well. Furthermore, verbal behavior can only be understood and categorized as argumentation, if the observer has prior reflective cognition. In other words, an argument can only be observed by someone who knows how to argue.

## Uneasiness

Humans are in a constant state of uneasiness. Or in other words, humans always have problems. Just one example is the physical requirement to supply the body with food and energy to continue to function. But regardless of how many problems have already been solved, there are always more things that can be improved, there is always more potential. There is the universal tendency towards entropy and decay.

## Ends

The general goal of humans is to alleviate uneasiness, to apply the solutions to the problems. Action is the deployment of scarce means to the attainment of the highest valued end. This requires the creative spark to imagining a future where the problem is in fact solved.

## Means

Actors utilize means to achieve their ends. Goods are the means required in order to satisfy wants. Without utilization of the means, the problem cannot be solved.

### Scarcity

Scarce means can only be utilized for one task at any given time. If there are multiple different tasks that all require the same mean, then the actor cannot satisfy all goals at the same time, he must choose one goal, and thus sacrifice the achievement of all other possible goals. Out of scarcity emerges a potential conflict of how to allocate the scarce resources available. 

Physical resources are scarce, as they can only be in one place at any given time.

If there are not enough scarce goods available to satisfy all the ends, then these goods must be economized. They must be allocated carefully, because if the good is applied to a less important problem, then it will not be available for solving the more important one. 

On the other hand, if the scarce good is abundant, then it is not subject to economization and can be considered a non-restraint for action. For example, air is generally abundant on earth's atmosphere, thus there is no need to economize how much air to breath in. However, once underwater and with only a small bottle of pressurized air, the actually scarce resource will be consumed quickly, and thus the actor has to economize how to use the resource.

### Non-Scarcity

There are however, non-scarce means that can be utilized for as many tasks as desired, simultaneously and at infinite scale. Thus there is no question of for which task to apply the good, the good is available for any possible task. No opportunity cost, and no sacrifice.

Information, patterns and ideas are non-scarce, they can be copied ad infinitum without taking away the use from anyone. The individual can continuously use the same strategy and information across solving different problems. He does not "forget" a piece of information after using it.

### Consumption goods

Those goods which are immediately and directly serviceable in the satisfaction of the actors wants are consumption goods. These goods of a lesser order are by themselves sufficient to alleviate the uneasiness of the actor, and their use leads to an immediate satisfaction.

### Production goods

However, most human desires are so sophisticated and complex, that only very few natural resources are sufficient in themselves to be satisfactorily consumed directly. Instead, those goods which only indirectly serve human desire are production goods. 

These goods of higher order can be shaped and transformed into consumption goods in the future by human action. Thus all steps in production take time, and the end result is always uncertain.

Factors of production can be sub-categorized into those that are of natural origin, and those that are man-made. The original factors of production can again be divided into the use of human energy, and non-human natural elements. The former is labor, the later is land.

Scarce production goods are thus land, labor and capital goods. These can only be used in one production stage at a time, and are often used up in the process.

However, there is one additional non-scarce resource required in production: the technological idea or strategy. Without such plan, the actor would not know how to move from one stage of production to another. Neither would he know that the consumption good is actually desirable. A recipe is required for every action and stage of production. Yet contrary to the previous scarce production goods these ideas of how to transform goods are non-scarce and can be enjoyed across numerous production stages and even cannot be used up.

## Subjective marginal preference scale

Each individual has the choice of using his available scarce resources for numerous alternative ends. The one he ends up choosing is his highest value goal, while all other alternatives are lover valued ends.

Each individual can, subjectively, rank order all his ends, by taking two outcomes, and asking which of them is better. When doing this with all current problems, the result is an ordered list with the most valued end on the top, and each following being less important.

This is an ordinal value scale, an absolute rank ordering. We cannot say by how much "units" one end is more valuable, but only that one is generally more valued than the other. This ordering of ends and means into a hierarchy is helpful in finding out what the most pressing problem is, the problem that if alleviated, the uneasiness would reduce the most.

Yet this subjective value scale differs for each individual, and even for the same individual across time. New ends can be introduced, while others become undesirable. The value judgment is in constant flux.

The exact naming of this value scale is irrelevant, it can be problem solving, welfare, happiness, utility, or satisfaction. The important concept is that the different ends are ranked based on their quality for the individual.

## Choice

Choice, then, is at the core of what it means to be human. With numerous problems, but limited scarce resources, humans must inevitably make a value judgement and choose one out of many. Every single action, is the proof of that choice, and it implies the infinite number of alternatives that have been sacrificed. Whenever there is choice, there is exchange. The individual exchanges a current state of affair, for a future one that he deems superior. 

## Judgement

Judgement is the other side of choice. After the act, individuals can judge themselves regarding weather or not their allocation of means has lead to their ends being achieved. The individual knows if his situation has improved, or worsened. This is a crucial ability to receive feedback across time and to qualify the success of a past exchange.

## Time

Time then, at least perceived by the individual, is experienced within every action. There is a clear differentiation in the timeline of "before" and "after" the act. Specifically there is a period before the action started, a point where the action begins, a period of production during of the action, a point at which the action stops, and a period after the action.

The period of production is separated into working time and maturing time. Working time is when labor energy is expanded, whereas maturing time is a required waiting time, without direct exposure of labor.

Memory of past actions and their results guide current moment decision making. Previous successful application of means to achieve ends are positively remembered and attempted again. Whereas those means that lead to a failure are noted for their disutility. And especially the capital goods acquired in the past are still relevant in the current moment decision making.

Yet every act presupposes the imagination of future scenarios, with consideration of how the individual actor can causally influence these. Precisely because of this plentiful human imagination, the future becomes uncertain. Out of all the possible dreams, which single one will manifest as actuality?

Once the act is done, there is no turning it back, time has passed irreversibly. Time travel is not possible, neither going back in time and choosing a different action, nor going forward in time to see the actual result of potential actions.

## Time Preference

The total time of individual human existence is limited, and the future is uncertain. It is very well possible to die in the very next instance, and the chances of death increase the longer we predict in the future.

Therefor it is reasonable to assume, that all things equal, individuals prefer satisfaction of their ends sooner, rather than later. The extend of how far gratification can be delayed is described as time preference. The longer an individual can delay satisfaction, the lower his time preference.

The extend of time preference varies across individual, and there it is not objectively better or worse to have a higher or lower time preference. This is a human preference, which is subjective to every actor, and thus no qualitative judgement can be made.

However, any actor displays at least a positive time preference. Every act leads to a realized satisfaction of ends, not deferred to the future. Thus only a non-actor can be considered to have a zero time preference.
