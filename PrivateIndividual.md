## The Human Axioms

There are two intertwined axioms at the very heart of our problem: humans act and humans argue.

The action axiom states that men allocate means in order to satisfy ends. Men are in a current state of uneasiness, with the creative imagination of numerous future scenarios, capable of making a value judgement and rank ordering these scenarios, and being able to reason about the costs of achieving them. In hindsight, humans judge weather or not the goal has been achieved and the situation improved.

Any attempt to refute the action axiom would in it self be an action, a behavior targeted at a goal, requiring resources, considering the opportunity cost of alternatives, and ultimately subject to a judgment of success or failure. The action axiom is self-evident for actors, and non-actors are not capable of reaching participatory understanding of it.

The argumentation axiom is that humans are capable of reasoning and discerning truth from falsehood. Lower forms of communication include sounds of expression like cries of pain, and warnings or signals of danger. Whereas higher communication entails descriptive language, which can be either true or false, and ultimately argumentation, which entails provable logic and explicit inferences. 

Similarly to the action axiom, a claim that one cannot argue would in it of itself be an argument, proclaiming a certain fact to be true, while others are false. Notice that this conundrum is also present for the isolated individual, as alone the thought of "I cannot argue" is an internal argument as well. Furthermore, verbal behavior can only be understood and categorized as argumentation, if the observer has prior reflective cognition. In other words, an argument can only be observed by someone who knows how to argue.

## Uneasiness

Humans are in a constant state of uneasiness. Or in other words, humans always have problems. Just one example is the physical requirement to suply the body with food and energy to continue to function. But regardless of how many problems have already been solved, there are always more things that can be improved, there is always more potential. There is the universal tendency towards entropy and decay.

 

## Scarcity

Actors utilize means to achieve their ends. Scarce means can only be utilized for one task at any given time. If there are multiple different tasks that all require the same mean, then the actor cannot satisfy all goals at the same time, he must choose one goal, and thus sacrifice the achievement of all other possible goals. Out of scarcity emerges a potential conflict of how to allocate the scarce resources available.
