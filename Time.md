# Time

Time then, at least perceived by the individual, is experienced within every action. There is a clear differentiation in the timeline of "before" and "after" the act. Specifically there is a period before the action started, a point where the action begins, a period of production during of the action, a point at which the action stops, and a period after the action.

The period of production is separated into working time and maturing time. Working time is when labor energy is expanded, whereas maturing time is a required waiting time, without direct exposure of labor.

Memory of past actions and their results guide current moment decision making. Previous successful application of means to achieve ends are positively remembered and attempted again. Whereas those means that lead to a failure are noted for their disutility. And especially the capital goods acquired in the past are still relevant in the current moment decision making.

Yet every act presupposes the imagination of future scenarios, with consideration of how the individual actor can causally influence these. Precisely because of this plentiful human imagination, the future becomes uncertain. Out of all the possible dreams, which single one will manifest as actuality?

Once the act is done, there is no turning it back, time has passed irreversibly. Time travel is not possible, neither going back in time and choosing a different action, nor going forward in time to see the actual result of potential actions.
