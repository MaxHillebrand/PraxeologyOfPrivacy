# Theft

Theft can be classified by three types of intervention that an individual or group can commit:

Autistic Intervention: This occurs when the intervener restricts an individual’s use of their own property without involving any exchange with others. The command or order only involves the subject themselves.

Binary Intervention: In this case, the intervener forces an exchange or coerces a “gift” from the individual. This establishes a hegemonic relation between the intervener and the subject.

Triangular Intervention: This type of intervention involves the intervener compelling or prohibiting an exchange between two subjects. This creates a hegemonic relation between the intervener and a pair of actual or potential exchangers.

All these interventions are examples of hegemonic relations, characterized by command and obedience, contrasting with the contractual, free-market relations of voluntary mutual benefit.
