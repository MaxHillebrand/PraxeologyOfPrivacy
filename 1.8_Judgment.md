# Judgment

Judgment is the other side of choice. After the act, individuals can judge themselves regarding whether or not their allocation of means has lead to their ends being achieved. The individual knows if his situation has improved, or worsened. This is a crucial ability to receive feedback across time and to qualify the success of a past exchange.

By judging the success of their choices, individuals are able to learn from their experiences and improve their future actions. If an action results in a favorable outcome, the individual will be more likely to repeat that action in the future. If an action results in an unfavorable outcome, the individual can use that information to adjust their behavior and make better choices in the future. In this way, the ability to judge the success of one's choices is a crucial component of the learning process.

On the other hand, if an individual repeatedly fails to achieve their desired ends, they may need to re-evaluate their goals or their means of achieving those goals. This requires introspection and self-awareness, as well as a willingness to adjust one's behavior in response to new information or changing circumstances. Individuals who are able to adapt and make changes to their behavior in response to feedback and new information are more likely to achieve their desired ends in the long run.
