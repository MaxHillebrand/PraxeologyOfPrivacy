# Capital Formation

Nature given resources are inherently limited in their available supply, and labor is limited in both it's supply and it's disutility of leisure forgone. In order to increase satisfaction of wants for a given period of time, the only method is to increase the quantity of capital goods employed.

In a primitive scenario, where the actor has zero producers goods, all of his time is spent on either leisure, or on acquiring consumers' good directly. This limits the actor to satisfying only those wants which do not have to rely on production, and only a small quantity of consumers' goods will be procured.

In order to increase productivity, the actor must mingle his unaided labor with the available natural resources to create capital goods of lower order. This always comes at the expense of satisfying his direct wants of consumers' goods. The time spent on creating a producer good cannot be spent on leisure, or on acquiring direct consumers' goods.

Deeper production stages can either increase the quantity of the same good, or enable the procurement of a new type of good not previously attainable without the required producers goods.

The individual will only work on increasing his capital stock, if the sacrifice of leisure forgone and of direct consumption in the present is estimated to be lower, than the potential benefit of more consumer' goods available, and a higher satisfaction of wants per unit of time in the future. The extend to which present sacrifice outweighs future return, is the individual's time preference. 

The point when the actor will stop to acquire direct consumer' goods, in favor of laboring on indirect producer goods, depends on the individual's subjective value scale. The more urgently he wants the producer good, the higher the rate of restriction of direct satisfaction.

Since after the completion of the producer good, the individual's productivity increases, he can either leisure more, or accumulate more consumer goods. Thus in order to maximize overall satisfaction, it might be favorable to prioritize the accumulation of producer's goods.

The time of production includes not only the time of the individuals direct action to create the producer's good, but it includes the entire waiting time starting from the first action of production, until the ultimate consumer good is completed. An increase in capital goods decreases the time until satisfaction of consumption goods.

Capital accumulation inherently relies on savings, meaning that not all desires are satisfied, even though the necessary consumer goods would be available. Without a saved stock of consumers goods, the actor cannot spend his time on deepening the production stages. He must instead invest some of his saved capital to sustain him during the production process, and he can only do this when previously he did not consume these relevant goods.

Most capital goods are perishable, meaning that they get used up and transformed during the process of production. Some goods might be transformed completely by only one use in the production stage, for example the flower required to bake a bread. Whereas other capital goods can be used in numerous production stages before it perishes, for example the oven that bakes the bread. For those long-lived producer goods, the depreciation rate is the inverse of the total expected lifetime.

If the actor wants to sustain his standard of living, he must strive to repair or replace the perishable capital goods at the time where they do break. This constant investment in upkeep of course also requires preexisting savings, like any production does.

Actors have three options: increase the capital structure, maintain the capital, or consuming the capital. The choice depends on the individual's disutility of waiting, which in turn depends on time preference, and his utility of higher productivity and thus more consumers' goods.

In order to satisfy his most urgent wants first, other things equal, the actor will build those consumer goods, which have the shortest production stage. Thus any additional saved capital, will be invested in marginally deeper production stages. Thus a wealthy economy with lots of capital will have production stages so deep, that those higher order capital goods are far removed from the ultimate consumers' good. 

Capital goods are stored up land, labor and time. 

The present value of a future good is derived by discounting it's future value with the rate of time preference. The higher the time preference, the higher the rate of discount, and thus the lower the present value of the future good. Individuals invest in production stages of those goods that have a higher discounted present value compared to the value of the present goods forgone.

The individual has at any time numerous potential investment opportunities, all discounted by his time preference. He will first invest his capital into those production stages with the highest present value, then into the second highest valued, and so on. On the other hand, with each investment, his stock of available present goods decreases, thus increasing the marginal value of the future consumers' goods. Investment stops at that point where the disutility of the present consumer goods is larger than the discounted present value of the future product.

The individual makes constant judgments of the uncertain future, and evaluates the likelihood that any possible scenario might end up manifesting in his experience. He acts toward that future scenario with the highest perceived value. However, if the resulting scenario is worse than he expected, then his speculations have failed. He either was wrong in the theory of how his actions would play out, or he made an actionable mistake deviating from the strategy.

As the quality of producer goods depreciates with time and use, and the replacement or repair comes with considerable opportunity cost, there is a point where the abandonment of a good is economically rational. Abandonment of capital means to forgo all possible use of that good in production and consumption, thus decreasing the quantity, quality and number of ends satisfied. However, when the continues cost of maintaining the capital good is marginally higher than its potential benefit, abandonment leads to an increase in total capital, it is not a waste.

In the choice of which land to use in production, the actor evaluates the different options based on their prospect of satisfying his ends. If the goal is to have more fruits, then settling on a land with fertile soil and existing fruit trees is more satisfactory than the other land with barren rocks. Capital will be deployed to develop those land areas which have a positive marginal return, whereas submarginal land will not be developed.

Land in its original state is not directly suitable for production. Instead, man has to labor the land, to shape and refine it into a state where it is more useful for his satisfaction. This act improves the land, and turns it into a saved capital good, the prerequisite of production.
