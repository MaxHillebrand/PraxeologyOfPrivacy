# The Human Axioms

The Human Axioms are two fundamental principles that lie at the foundation of economic science. The first axiom, the action axiom, states that humans act in order to achieve their goals. This principle is based on the observation that individuals are always in a state of uneasiness, with a variety of different goals and desires that they seek to satisfy. In order to achieve these goals, individuals must allocate their scarce resources in a way that will enable them to achieve the greatest level of satisfaction. The action axiom is a self-evident truth, as any attempt to refute it would itself be an action, and would require the use of scarce resources and the calculation of opportunity costs.

The second axiom, the argumentation axiom, asserts that humans are capable of reasoning and discerning truth from falsehood. This principle is based on the observation that individuals are capable of engaging in argumentation, which involves the use of provable logic and explicit inferences to establish the truth of a claim. Argumentation is the highest form of communication, and it is what enables individuals to arrive at a shared understanding of the world around them. Moreover, for verbal behavior to be recognized and classified as argumentation, the observer must possess prior reflective cognition. In simpler terms, only individuals who have knowledge of the principles of argumentation can recognize and identify it in others. The argumentation axiom is also self-evident, as any claim that one cannot argue would itself be an argument, and would imply that the claim is false.

The two axioms of human action and argumentation are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. The action axiom, which states that individuals allocate means to achieve ends, presupposes that individuals possess the ability to reason and choose between various ends. The argumentation axiom, which states that individuals are capable of reasoning and discerning truth from falsehood, provides a means for individuals to communicate and debate the merits of various courses of action. Thus, the action axiom relies on the argumentation axiom for individuals to be able to distinguish between different ends, and the argumentation axiom relies on the action axiom for individuals to have something to reason about. In this way, the two axioms complement and reinforce each other, forming the basis of human behavior and social interaction.

The action and argumentation axioms also imply that individuals are capable of making judgments about the truth and falsity of claims, and of using this knowledge to guide their actions. This ability to reason and to act on the basis of reason is what makes humans unique among all living creatures. It is what has enabled us to build civilizations, create works of art and literature, and to explore the mysteries of the universe.
