# The Human Axioms

The Human Axioms are two fundamental principles that lie at the foundation of economic science. The first axiom, the action axiom, states that humans act in order to achieve their goals. This principle is based on the observation that individuals are always in a state of uneasiness, with a variety of different goals and desires that they seek to satisfy. In order to achieve these goals, individuals must allocate their scarce resources in a way that will enable them to achieve the greatest level of satisfaction. The action axiom is a self-evident truth, as any attempt to refute it would itself be an action, and would require the use of scarce resources and the calculation of opportunity costs.

The second axiom, the argumentation axiom, asserts that humans are capable of reasoning and discerning truth from falsehood. This principle is based on the observation that individuals are capable of engaging in argumentation, which involves the use of provable logic and explicit inferences to establish the truth of a claim. Argumentation is the highest form of communication, and it is what enables individuals to arrive at a shared understanding of the world around them. Moreover, for verbal behavior to be recognized and classified as argumentation, the observer must possess prior reflective cognition. In simpler terms, only individuals who have knowledge of the principles of argumentation can recognize and identify it in others. The argumentation axiom is also self-evident, as any claim that one cannot argue would itself be an argument, and would imply that the claim is false.

The interplay between the action and argumentation axioms is what makes human society possible. Individuals are able to communicate their goals and desires through argumentation, and to coordinate their actions in a way that will enable them to achieve their desired ends. The action and argumentation axioms also imply that individuals are capable of making judgments about the truth and falsity of claims, and of using this knowledge to guide their actions. This ability to reason and to act on the basis of reason is what makes humans unique among all living creatures. It is what has enabled us to build civilizations, create works of art and literature, and to explore the mysteries of the universe.
