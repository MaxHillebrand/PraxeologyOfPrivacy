# Observing other individuals

In economic analysis, the isolated individual serves as a starting point for examining individual action, with the assumption that humans act in accordance with their subjective preferences to achieve desired ends. However, individuals rarely exist in isolation, and the observation of other individuals becomes a necessary component of economic analysis when considering social interaction. When individuals are no longer isolated but interact with one another, the complexity of economic analysis increases. Nevertheless, the basic principles of economic analysis continue to apply.

Observation of other individuals can provide valuable information for an individual. By observing another's actions, an individual can learn about what goods and services are in demand, the methods for producing those goods, and the methods for satisfying the wants of other individuals. The knowledge gained from observation can help individuals make more informed decisions in their own economic activities.

In addition to learning, observation can lead to the formation of judgments and opinions about others. By observing others, an individual may form opinions about the character or trustworthiness of others, leading to changes in behavior.
