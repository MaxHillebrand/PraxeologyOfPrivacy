# Uneasiness

Humans are in a constant state of uneasiness. Or in other words, humans always have problems. Just one example is the physical requirement to supply the body with energy in form of food to continue to function. But regardless of how many problems have already been solved, there are always more things that can be improved, there is always more potential. If there would exist a state without uneasiness, then there would be no problems to be solved, therefor no action possible. An actor can thus not experience a lack of uneasiness, as he would cease to be an actor in that very moment. 

There is the universal tendency towards entropy and decay.
