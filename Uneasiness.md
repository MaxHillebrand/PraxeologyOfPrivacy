# Uneasiness

Humans are always in a state of uneasiness, and every action taken by an individual is intended to alleviate it. This is a fundamental characteristic of human beings, as the state of perfect contentment and satisfaction is unattainable. The desire to improve one's current state is an ongoing pursuit, and there is always more potential for growth and development. If one were to achieve a state of total satisfaction, there would be no further need for action, and they would cease to be an actor altogether.

Additionally, the second law of thermodynamics states that there is a universal tendency towards entropy and decay. All physical systems tend towards disorder and chaos, and the same is true of the human condition. Any order or structure that exists must be constantly maintained and supported, as without effort, it will inevitably fall apart.
Therefore, individuals must continually work to maintain and improve their condition, as the alternative is to allow entropy to take over and lead to decay and destruction. This requires effort and action, but it is a necessary aspect of the human experience. The struggle against entropy is an ongoing challenge, but it is also what gives life purpose and meaning.

In summary, the human condition is one of constant uneasiness and struggle, but it is also one of potential and growth. The pursuit of improvement and the struggle against decay are essential components of the human experience, and they require ongoing effort and action to maintain.
