# Ends

The general goal of humans is to alleviate uneasiness, to apply the solutions to their problems. Action is the deployment of scarce means to the attainment of the highest valued end. This requires the creative spark to imagining a future where the problem is in fact solved. Only individuals can have ends, there are no ends of groups or collectives. Individuals must have a possible mode of behavior to enable them to attain the ends. An end that is unachievable for the individual is not relevant for his mode of action. He must have an idea of how to achieve his end.
