# Law of marginal utility

Each distinct unit of means involved in human action is valued separately. Actors do not choose from general categories like steak vs bananas, but always with specific quantities of each, like one steak vs two bananas.

However, the subjective value scale is ordinal, not kardinal, and thus the value of multiple distinct units of a mean cannot be the multiple of it's single value. In a scenario where multiple means must be chosen in aggregate, the value of the aggregate is unique in its rank in the individuals subjective value scale.

So long as an additional unit can be used to satisfy an end, having more goods is valued more than having less goods. However, having ten times as many goods does not mean it is ten times as valuable.

Goods can be interchangeable, if the actor has equal satisfaction with each of the means, for example three bananas are not unique, and thus the actor is happy with any one of them. If contrarily, the options have each unique characteristics, like rib-eye steak, sirloin steak, or flank steak, then these are not three interchangeable units, but each unique in the preference scale. As soon as the actor values each unit of a mean distinctly, it is no longer part of the supply of the homogeneous good.

The first unit of mean will be allocated to the highest value end on the individual's preference scale. The next available unit will be used to satisfy the second highest end. Each additional unit of mean will thus lead to the satisfaction of lower valuable ends. Contrarily with a decrease in available homogeneous means, the actor will stop the pursuit of the previously satisfied lowest valued end.

The greater the supply of a good, the lower the marginal utility. The lower the supply of a good, the higher the marginal utility. When choosing between units of two good based on the supply available. The marginal utility is higher for the good which the actor prefers.
