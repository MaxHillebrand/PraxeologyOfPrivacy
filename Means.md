# Means

Actors utilize means to achieve their ends. Goods are the means required in order to satisfy wants. Without utilization of the means, the problem cannot be solved. Means are part of the environment of men, and they are changed by the actions of men, in order to manifest an environment which is more to the liking of the actor.

There are elements of the actors situation which he cannot change or control, those are general conditions of action. However, the other elements are those which he can manipulate to his desire, and these are the means employed by action. 

Action thus requires the technological ideas of how to utilize some of the environmental elements as means, with the intent to attaining some ends. However, the general conditions of the environment are out of the power of individuals, and thus they are never objects of any human action.
