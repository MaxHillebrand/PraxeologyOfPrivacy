# Choice

Choice, then, is at the core of what it means to be human. With numerous problems, but limited scarce resources, humans must inevitably make a value judgment and choose one out of many. Every single action is the proof of that choice, and it implies the infinite number of alternatives that have been sacrificed. Whenever there is choice, there is exchange. The individual exchanges a current state of affair, for a future one that he deems superior. The list of alternatives that were not pursued are the opportunity cost of action, those potential future scenarios that were disregarded and not manifested.
