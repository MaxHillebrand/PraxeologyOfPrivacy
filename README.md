# The Praxeology of Privacy

### A fundamental treatise on the individual property right to selectively reveal oneself to the world.

## Abstract

### I - The Individual - Exist

This, shall be the single axiom, the assumption on top of which a monumental construct can be logically deduced. The Individual is in a constant state of uneasiness, and has the creative spark to imagine multiple superior scenarios. The heroic entrepreneur acts, allocating scarce resources to manifest his most wanted desires. The Sovereign Individual claims his property, and has the power to defend what is his. In the darkness of Crypto Anarchy, cypherpunks control how to selectively reveal themselves to the world, thriving in the free realm of cyberspace. No trusted third party will secure Individual liberty, One must build his own weapons, and stand strong in this onslaught of the Digital Totality.
