# Production goods

However, most human desires are so sophisticated and complex, that only very few natural resources are sufficient in themselves to be satisfactorily consumed directly. The second category of goods are those, which only indirectly serve human desire.

These goods of higher order can be shaped and transformed into consumption goods in the future, but only by human action. Thus all steps in production take time, and the end result is always uncertain.

Factors of production can be sub-categorized into those that are of natural origin, and those that are man-made. The original factors of production can again be divided into the use of human energy, and non-human natural elements. The former is labor, the later is land.

Scarce production goods are thus land, labor and capital goods. These can only be used in one production stage at a time, and are often used up in the process.

However, there is one additional non-scarce resource required in production: the technological idea or strategy. Without such plan, the actor would not know how to move from one stage of production to another. Neither would he know that the consumption good is actually desirable. A recipe is required for every action and stage of production. Yet contrary to the previous scarce production goods these ideas of how to transform goods are non-scarce and can be enjoyed across numerous production stages and they even cannot be used up.
