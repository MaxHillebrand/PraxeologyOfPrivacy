# Scarcity

Scarce means can only be utilized for one task at any given time. If there are multiple different tasks that all require the same mean, then the actor cannot attain all ends at the same time, he must choose one goal, and thus sacrifice the achievement of all other possible goals. Out of scarcity emerges a potential conflict of how to allocate the scarce resources available. 

Physical resources are scarce, as they can only be in one place at any given time.

If there are not enough scarce means available to satisfy all the ends, then these goods must be economized. They must be allocated carefully, because if the good is applied to a less important problem, then it will not be available for solving the more important one. 

On the other hand, if the scarce good is abundant, then it is not subject to economization and can be considered a non-restraint for action. For example, air is generally abundant on earth's atmosphere, thus there is no need to economize how much air to breath in. However, once underwater and with only a small bottle of pressurized air, the actually scarce resource will be consumed quickly, and thus the actor has to economize how to use the resource.
