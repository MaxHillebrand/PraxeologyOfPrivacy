# Scarcity

Actors utilize means to achieve their ends. Scarce means can only be utilized for one task at any given time. If there are multiple different tasks that all require the same mean, then the actor cannot satisfy all goals at the same time, he must choose one goal, and thus sacrifice the achievement of all other possible goals. Out of scarcity emerges a potential conflict of how to allocate the scarce resources available.
