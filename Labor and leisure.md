# Labor and leisure

Humans have unlimited ends, yet the factors of production required to create consumer goods are scarce. Thus in order to satisfy more ends, more consumer goods need to be produced, which in turn requires an increase in the supply of it's factors. Because natural resources are inherently limited, the only other options are to increase the stock of capital goods, or to increase the expenditure of labor.

There are, however, limitations on the extend that labor expenditure can be increased. Firstly, by the quantity of humans available, second by the quality or skill of each human, and finally by the willingness for those humans to work.

The willingness to work, depends like all action, on the choice and opportunity cost. The opportunity cost to labor, is leisure. Leisure is assumed to be a consumer's good. Increased labor thus decreases the supply of leisure, which in turn increases the marginal utility of leisure, and decreases the marginal utility of the consumer's good. Whereas an increase in leisure, decreases the marginal utility of leisure, but decreases the supply of labor, and thus increasing it's marginal utility. Man labors only when the marginal utility of labor outweighs the marginal disutility of leisure forgone.

The disutility of labor can further increase above the leisure foregone, in the case that the labor has undesirable aspects in itself. Both cleaning the dishes, and working in the depths of a coal mine decrease the actors leisure, however, working in a coal mine is for many actors more painful than cleaning the dishes.

Whereas labor is always targeted towards the attainment of a final product, play is action which is purely for it's own sake. Play is thus, like leisure, a consumer's good with diminishing marginal utility.

The question of what to labor on, depends on the disutility of leisure foregone and the dissatisfaction of the specific work itself, as well as the utility of the contribution towards the production of the desired goods. Every hour of labor will be spent on attaining that good with the highest marginal product.
