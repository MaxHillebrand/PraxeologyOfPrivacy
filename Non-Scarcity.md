# Non-Scarcity

There are however, non-scarce means that can be utilized for as many tasks as desired, simultaneously and at infinite scale. Thus there is no question for which task to apply the good, the good is available for any possible task. No opportunity cost, and no sacrifice.

Information, patterns and ideas are non-scarce, they can be copied ad infinitum without taking away the use from anyone. The individual can continuously use the same strategy and information across solving different problems. He does not "forget" a piece of information after using it.

These non-scarce means are information are an essential component of every action. Because even if all scarce physical goods are abundantly available, without the knowledge of how to change those means in a way that they attain the desired ends, no action is possible, and all problems remain unsolved.
