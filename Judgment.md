# Judgment

Judgment is the other side of choice. After the act, individuals can judge themselves regarding whether or not their allocation of means has lead to their ends being achieved. The individual knows if his situation has improved, or worsened. This is a crucial ability to receive feedback across time and to qualify the success of a past exchange.

When repeatedly after the action the situation is worse than expected, then either the goal is unattainable, the utilized means are not relevant, the actually relevant means are not utilized, or the correct information of how to apply the means to achieve the ends is not known.

But in any case, humans know when they do not live up to their potential, when they do not manifest what they know that they could achieve, if only they get their act together.
