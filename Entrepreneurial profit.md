# Entrepreneurial profit

Entrepreneurial profit is driven by the subjective value individuals place on goods, which is determined by their position in the preference scale relative to the total supply of the good. While consumer goods have a direct use value, production goods are valued for their potential to be transformed into ultimate consumption goods. The value of a production good is determined by the least important good that the individual would have to give up if a unit of production good were removed. In essence, the value of a production good is derived from the satisfaction provided by its marginal product. This process of subjective valuation forms the basis of entrepreneurial profit, as individuals identify and exploit opportunities to transform less valuable goods into more highly valued ones through the use of production goods.

In the economic realm, scarcity is a fundamental and pervasive fact of life. This reality is rooted in the fact that consumer goods must be produced and, therefore, the resources needed to produce them are also scarce. Even if a factor of production can be used to produce different types of consumer goods, the individual must make a choice among many potential uses. A single producer good is insufficient to transform into a consumer good since it does not satisfy any of the individual's wants directly. Rather, it is through the combination of two or more producer goods that the individual can advance the production process and bring about the satisfaction of his wants.

In accordance with the basic economic principle of maximizing utility, the actor seeks to employ a given quantity of production factors in a manner that maximizes the value of the produced outputs, in terms of quantity, quality, and timeliness of production. Consequently, for any quantity of production goods, there is one single optimal outcome that maximizes subjective value.
