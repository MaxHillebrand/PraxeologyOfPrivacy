# Entrepreneurial profit

Entrepreneurial profit is driven by the subjective value individuals place on goods, which is determined by their position in the preference scale relative to the total supply of the good. While consumer goods have a direct use value, production goods are valued for their potential to be transformed into ultimate consumption goods. The value of a production good is determined by the least important good that the individual would have to give up if a unit of production good were removed. In essence, the value of a production good is derived from the satisfaction provided by its marginal product. This process of subjective valuation forms the basis of entrepreneurial profit, as individuals identify and exploit opportunities to transform less valuable goods into more highly valued ones through the use of production goods.

In the economic realm, scarcity is a fundamental and pervasive fact of life. This reality is rooted in the fact that consumer goods must be produced and, therefore, the resources needed to produce them are also scarce. Even if a factor of production can be used to produce different types of consumer goods, the individual must make a choice among many potential uses. A single producer good is insufficient to transform into a consumer good since it does not satisfy any of the individual's wants directly. Rather, it is through the combination of two or more producer goods that the individual can advance the production process and bring about the satisfaction of his wants.

In accordance with the basic economic principle of maximizing utility, the actor seeks to employ a given quantity of production factors in a manner that maximizes the value of the produced outputs, in terms of quantity, quality, and timeliness of production. Consequently, for any quantity of production goods, there is one single optimal outcome that maximizes subjective value.

In the arena of market competition, uncertainty reigns supreme. If all future events could be perfectly predicted, there would be no risk, and no possibility of entrepreneurial profit. However, since the future is by nature unpredictable, entrepreneurs can reap the rewards of their foresight in anticipating and exploiting future opportunities that others have missed. It is the successful entrepreneur who manages to perceive the previously unperceived profit opportunity, and thereby outsmarts his competitors by using his scarce resources to the fullest advantage. Thus, it is the presence of uncertainty and the skillful application of entrepreneurial judgment that creates the potential for profit and drives the dynamism of the market economy.

Entrepreneurial profit is one of the most important elements of the market economy, and it arises due to the subjective nature of human action. All action is taken with the expectation of future gain, but the future is always uncertain. It is the role of the entrepreneur to bear this uncertainty, to identify market opportunities, and to allocate scarce resources in a way that is most likely to generate a profit. By doing so, the entrepreneur creates value for society, and is rewarded with profit if their forecasts are accurate. However, if they are incorrect, then they must bear the cost of their error. Thus, entrepreneurial profit is a function of the market process and the individual judgement of the entrepreneur, and is a critical component of the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the market economy.
