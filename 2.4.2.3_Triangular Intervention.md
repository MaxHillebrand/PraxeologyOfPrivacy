# Triangular Intervention

Triangular intervention is a concept that refers to the act of a third party, typically a government or regulatory body, intervening in the exchange between two other parties. This intervention can take various forms, such as price control and licensing.

Price Control is a form of triangular intervention where the government sets a minimum or maximum price for a particular good or service. This means that individuals are prohibited from making an exchange below or above this set price. For example, a government might set a maximum price for basic food items to ensure affordability for all citizens. However, this can lead to unintended consequences such as shortages if the price is set too low, or surpluses if the price is set too high.

Licensing, on the other hand, is a form of triangular intervention where the government restricts certain individuals or businesses from engaging in specific exchanges without a license. For instance, in many countries, one must obtain a license to practice medicine or law.
